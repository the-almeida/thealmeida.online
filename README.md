## Running Locally


```sh-session
npm install -g pnpm
git clone https://github.com/theAlmeidaOnline/thealmeida.online.git
cd thealmeida.online
```
Create an account and empty database on [Upstash](https://upstash.com).

Create a `.env` file similar to [`.env.example`] and fill it up with the database information from [Upstash](https://upstash.com).


Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
